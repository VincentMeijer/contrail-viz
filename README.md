# Visualizations of various aspects of contrail science
This repository contains various web-based visualizations of concepts related to the science of contrails.

## Set up
Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed. Then, to install the required packages, you can run
```shell
npm install
```
To start the app
```shell
node app.js
```
this will start a local server on port 3000 (you can modify this port in `app.js`), which you can use to browse the visualizations.
